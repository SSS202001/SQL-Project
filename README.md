# Analysis of Layoff Trends in the Tech Industry

## Description
This project analyzes layoff trends in the tech industry using a dataset containing information on layoffs across various companies. The goal is to uncover patterns and insights regarding layoffs, such as the impact of funding, industry differences, and geographical trends.


## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information on 2361 layoff events, with details about the companies, their locations, industries, the number of employees laid off, the percentage of the workforce affected, the date of layoffs, the stage of the company, the country, and the funds raised by these companies.
## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
The data cleaning script handles tasks such as handling null values, removing duplicates, standardizing data, and fixing errors.
Key Steps:

Inspecting raw data
Creating a staging table
Handling null values
Removing duplicates
Standardizing data
Final cleanup

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
The EDA script explores the data to find trends, patterns, and outliers, using basic and advanced SQL queries.

Key Steps:

Inspecting the staging table
Basic queries to explore the data
Intermediate queries using GROUP BY
Advanced queries for deeper insights
## Insights and Results

- The industry with the highest number of layoffs.
- Average percentage of layoffs by industry.
- Layoffs trends over time.
- Layoffs comparison across different company stages and countries.
## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the ability to handle and analyze large datasets using SQL. The data cleaning process ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data, while the EDA provides valuable insights into layoff trends in the tech industry.
